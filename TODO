Todo:
1: Implement loggers for various notifications and so on. For example, if a specific binding is ignored because it is

2: Generate all the documentation for the project
3: Implement requeing/signaling mechanism for listeners
4: Show examples of implementing complex topologies like dead-lettering on cancel
