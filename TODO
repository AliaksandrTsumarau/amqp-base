Todo:
1: Implement loggers for various notifications and so on. For example, if a specific binding is ignored because it is
missing one component, would be interesting to know about it
2: Generate all the documentation for the project
3: Provide wrappers for various types of listeners and producers
    - work queues
    - pubsub
    - rpc
    - topics
